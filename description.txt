This mod patches Vanilla to have a variable maximum NPC limit.
In tML for Terraria 1.4.3 all the mods cannot be notified correctly of this change
so they can and probably will have problems unless they are created with this mod in mind.
In a similar way to avoid compatibility errors it's suggested to only increase the NPC limit,
although this mod allows also to decrease it.

Keep in mind that many parts of Terraria relay on looping over the NPC array so increasing this
value a lot has the effect of decreasing performance.

IMPORTANT:
- "Prevent double IL application" is false by default in the config, it's IMPORTANT that this stays
false to interact with more complex mods using heavy IL (like MultiSpawn); this prevents the mod from
loading correctly tho if you Mod Reload in game (Suggested usage, setup all mods with reload required
fields, set the NPC limit in this mod and exit tML, THEN reopen it and never reload mod again)

MODS SUPPORTING AND USING THIS:
- MultiSpawn >= 0.8

Changelog:
- 0.6
-- Description and checks for reload behaviour (see IMPORTANT above)
- 0.5
-- Fixed major bugs for world load/save in 1.4.3

Known problems:
- Reload behaviour and compatibility with other IL mods (see IMPORTANT above)
- Long load time for the mod (changing the cap is realtime and can be done in game)
- Not yet mapped to relative the spawn positions of special bosses in vanilla. (@TODO)
